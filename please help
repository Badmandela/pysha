Sorry about this, but i don't know how else to contact you.
I'm wondering if you could please help me out in setting up your version of Pysha. And if possible, doing some custom mods as well.
I would pay you for your time.
I have been a long time user of a standalone Push1 system, and discovering Pysha would unlock alot of capabilities for me.
If you could please respond, it would mean a great deal to me. You can dm my instagram @badmandela or email me badmandela@gmail.com
Many thanks
